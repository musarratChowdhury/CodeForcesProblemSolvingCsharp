Big O Notation allows us to compare algorithms independently of input size;

we often use the worst case time complexity is the deciding factor;


O(1) or constant time; 
O(n) or linear time;
O(log(n)) or logarithmic time
O(n2) or exponential time
O(n!) or factorial time 


We can use big-O Notation for space complexity as well ;
